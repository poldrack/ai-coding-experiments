  Artificial intelligence (AI) tools based on large language models have acheived human-level performance on some computer programming tasks.  We report several experiments using GPT-4 to generate computer code.  These experiments demonstrate that AI code generation using the current generation of tools, while powerful, requires substantial human validation to ensure accurate performance. We also demonstrate that GPT-4 refactoring of existing code can significantly improve that code along several established metrics for code quality, and we show that GPT-4 can generate tests with substantial coverage, but that many of the tests fail when applied to the associated code. These findings suggest that while AI coding tools are very powerful, they still require humans in the loop to ensure validity and accuracy of the results.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Recent developments in artificial intelligence, particularly through large language models, have enabled the automated generation of computer code [@Chen2021; @Bubeck2023]. In particular, GPT-4 has enabled human-level performance on a set of coding challenges that are outside of the training set of the model [@Bubeck2023].  In addition, automated coding assistants (particularly Github Copilot) have become integrated into commmon devlopment environments and are widely used, with some evidence that they can signficantly improve coding productivity. The performance of these models is also raising important questions regarding coding education, given that the current models can easily complete most coding problem sets using in introductory programming courses [@FinnieAnsley2022].  

In the present paper we explore some of the implications of AI-assisted coding using GPT-4, in a more qualitative way than previous benchmarking assessments.  First we examine the experience of interactive coding and debugging using the ChatGPT interface to GPT-4 on a set of data science coding problems.  This experiment is meant to approximate the experience of a researcher with minimal expertise in prompt engineering, assessing the success and amount of effort required to perform these coding tasks.  Second, we assess the ability of GPT-4 (using the OpenAI API) to refactor and improve the quality of existing code.  This experiment is meant to assess the degree to which AI coding assistants might improve coding quality when used by researcers.  Third, we assess the ability of GPT-4 to write tests for its own code, using a set of test prompts from several scientific domains.  We conclude with an overall assessment of the utility of AI coding assistants for scientific researchers, and discuss educational, ethical, and legal implications of these tools.

# Coding with GPT-4

Our first set of experiments examined the ability of GPT-4 (via the ChatGPT interface) to generate usable code for a set of data science problems.   The prompts were generated manually (by author RP) and are listed in Appendix 1.  Each prompt was submitted in a separate chat session; the human examined the resulting code, and issued additional prompts to try to fix problems, .  If the human was not able to obtain working code within about 5 minutes of effort or less, the problem was deemed unsolved.  The results of this experiment are primarily qualitiative and subjective, but are meant to index the degree to which GPT-4 is a useful tool for a researcher.

```{python}
#| eval: True
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
#| echo: False
#| label: fig-prompts-plot
#| fig-cap: "Proportion of successful code outcomes as a function of number of prompts. NS: not successful."


import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(5,3))
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poldrack/ai-coding-experiments/main/data/chatgpt/gpt4_coding_results.tsv', sep='\t')
df['NumPromptsToSuccess'] = df['NumPromptsToSuccess'].apply(lambda x: x if isinstance(x, str) and x.isdigit() else 'NS')
sns.set(font_scale=1.3)
_ = sns.histplot(df.NumPromptsToSuccess, stat='density')
plt.ylabel('Proportion')
_ = plt.xlabel('Num prompts to success')
```


@fig-prompts-plot shows the proportion of successful outcomes as a function of the number of prompts required.  72\% (23/32)) of attempts were successful in relatively quickly solving the problem; 37.5\% (12/32) were successful on the first prompt. In cases where additional prompting was required, a common problem was the use of outdated functions or datasets from Python libraries.   

The causes of unsuccessful outcomes were varied.  In some cases it was due to outdated training data.  For example, in one case (prompt #12) ChatGPT could not successfully implement a solution that was compatible with the latest version of PyTorch. In another case (prompt #27), the labels used to query the NOAA API were incorrect, and the correct labels were not easily identifable upon further examination.   In other cases, it was not immediately clear what was wrong with the code, and the researcher did not dig deeply enough to identify the root cause.

One of the examples highlights the contining challenges that ChatGPT has with mathematical processing (as outlined by @Bubeck2023).  Prompt #4 asked ChatGPT to generate code to simulate a drift diffusion model (a common model for response times in cognitive psychology) and then fit the model parameters using the EZ-diffusion model [@Wagenmakers2007], which is a closed-form solution to estimating these parameters using response time and accuracy statistics.  The initial code generated by ChatGPT attempted to fit a diffusion model through numerical optimization.  After being prompted to generate a closed-form solution based on the original paper, ChatGPT did so, but the formula bore little resemblance to the actual formula from the paper.  This is an example of a "hallucination" which is commonly seen with LLMs [@Ji2023], and highlights the ongoing need for automatically generated code to be validated by a human.

Another example also highlights the need for domain knowledge in assessing the outputs of ChatGPT. Prompt #18 asked ChatGPT to implement a *hurdle model*, which is a statistical model for zero-inflated count data that combines a binary model with count model using a truncated distribution.  In general, this model is fit by performing maximum likelihood estimation on the combined likelihoods of the binary and count models. ChatGPT generated a solution that separately estimated a binary model and a count model, and then combined the predictions from the two models; this incorrect approach can be found in a number of examples from Github.  This model fit the test data nearly as well as a reference implementation of the hurdle model (impmented in R), but is incorrect due to the lack of use of a truncated count distribution.  This highlights the need for close attention to detail in the implementation of any numerical methods, as incorrect implementations present on Github can result in incorrect outcomes.

## Refactoring code using GPT4

The quality of research code is important for scientific reproducibility and transparency, as well as for code reusability and maintainability.  In our initial explorations of code generated by GPT-4, we noted that the automatically generated code appeared to be substantially more readable than research code that we have encountered (or written) in the past.  This led us to ask whether GPT-4 could improve the quality of existing code through *refactoring* [@Fowler2019], by which we mean modifying code to make it more readable or maintainable without changing its behavior.

To assess this, we downloaded more than 2000 examples of Python code from Github using the Githb Code Search API. Only one code file was allowed from any single repository.  We further filtered these files, based in part on the criteria used by @Chen2021 to select code for training of the OpenAI Codex model.  Exclusion criteria included:

- Presence of non-Python code (as guessed by `guesslang.Guess()`)
- Presence of non-English language in the code (according to `pycld2.detect()`)
- Presence of potential markers of automatic generation (e.g. strings such as "autogenerated", "generated by Django", etc)
- Presence of potential obfuscation (the "if x - y:" pattern)
- Lack of at least one function definition
- Number of GPT tokens greater than 2500 or less than 200
- Maximum line length > 1000
- Mean line length > 100
- Maximum file size > 1MB

The 269 code files passing these criteria were submitted to further analysis. Analysis of syntax errors and coding style was performed using the `flake8` static code analysis package. Files were further excluded on the basis of any syntax errors identified by flake8.  

The number of warning and error messages emitted by the flake8 linter was substantially reduced for the refactored code compared to the original (median 0.23 messages/line for original vs 0.09 messages/line for refactored, Cohen's d = 0.50; see @fig-messages-plot).  While tools exist to perform automatic reformatting to ensure standard-compliance, this shows that GPT-4 generates code that is substantially more standards-compliant than the average programmer; given that the files sampled from Github were heavily filtered, this result is probably an underestimate.  @fig-errors-plot provides an overview of which errors were most common in the original code and how their prevalence changed after refactoring.

![Prevalence of individual Flake8 warning/error codes for original github files and refactored files. Values are sorted by prevalence in the original github files.](../images/flake8_errors.png){#fig-errors-plot}


We further examined a set of code quality metrics, which were computed using the `radon` Python package.  Metrics extracted from these outputs for further analysis included:

- Logical lines of code
- Number of comments
- Mean cyclomatic complexity (a measure of the number of execution paths)
- Maintainability index (a holistic metric for code maintainability, based on a composite of several metrics including Halstead volume @Halstead1977, cyclomatic complexity, lines of code, and \% of comments)
- Halstead "difficulty" (a metric of how difficult the code is to read, based on the number of distinct operators and the ratio of total number of operands to number of distinct operands)
- Halstead "bugs" (a metric meant to estimate the number of bugs in delivered code)

Comparisons between metrics for the original and refactored code are shown in @fig-metrics, and means and p-values for the comparison (using a paired t-test) are shown in @tbl-metrics.  Each of these metrics differed between the origin and refactored code (p < .05 after false discovery rate correction across all hypotheses).  However, the effect sizes were all in the small to medium range, with Cohen's d values ranging from 0.13 to 0.33.

## Automatically generated code and tests

Given the importance of validating AI-generated code using software tests, we next assessed the ability of GPT-4 to generate tests for its own code.  We first used GPT-4 to generate 20 prompts for each of 5 different areas of research, using the following prompt: "Please generate 20 prompts to ask a chatbot to create Python code to solve a variety of {statistical and data science, physics, theoretical computer science, ecology, economics} problems.  Please embed the code within an explicit code block, surrounded by triple-backtick markers."

For each of the generated problems, we created a prompt to generate the code along with tests for the resulting code, such as the following:

> Write a Python program to simulate predator-prey interactions using the Lotka-Volterra equations, given the initial populations, growth rates, and interaction coefficients. Please embed the code within an explicit code block, surrounded by triple-backtick markers. Generate realistic values for any examples, and do not use input() commands. Create code that is modular and well-commented.  Then, generate a set of pytest tests that exercise each of the functions, embedded in a separate code block.

We first examined whether each generated script would execute without failure; of the 100 generated scripts, 97 executed successfully.  We then examined test coverage using the `Coverage.py` tool. As shown in @fig-test-coverage, the majority of files had test coverage of 100%, with 94% showing a coverage of at least 50% ad a minimum coverage of 40%. there was a weak but statistically significant negative relationship between the number of statements and the level of coverage (Spearman r = -0.23, p = .02).  A median of three tests were generated for each file.


```{python}
#| eval: True
#| echo: False
#| label: fig-test-coverage
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-cap: "Percentage of test coverage as a function of the number of statements in the automatically generated code."

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np


coverage_df = pd.read_csv("../results/conceptual_prompting/code_coverage.csv")

def jitter(values,width):
    return values + np.random.uniform(-(width/2), width/2, values.shape)

sns.set_style("white")
sns.set(font_scale=1.2)

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))
s = sns.scatterplot(x=coverage_df.statements, 
                    y=jitter(coverage_df.coverage, 2),
                  alpha=0.8)
s.set_xticks(np.arange(0, 61, 10))
_ = plt.ylim(0, 105)
_ = plt.xlim(0, 62)
pctfull = (coverage_df.coverage == 100).mean() * 100
# plt.text(10, 20, f'{int(pctfull)}% of tests had 100% coverage')
_ = plt.xlabel('Number of statements in answer')
_ = plt.ylabel('Test coverage (percent)')

```


Running the tests required minor automated modification to the code, since the tests required importing the relevant functions but the names of the output files were not known to ChatGPT.  After fixing this issue, 45 of the 100 tests completed successfully.  The most common source of test failure was failure of a value assertion (47/100); in these cases, it was not immediately possible to determine whether the test or code was incorrect, without additional debugging.  In ten cases, the test failed because the code did not raise the error expected by the test. In six cases, other errors were raised (Type, Index, Value, and ZeroDivision errors).  

In summary, our analyses of automatic test generation demonstrate that GPT-4 can successfully generate testing code with good coverage, but that these tests fail often, requiring additional debugging to determine the root cause of the test failure.

## Conclusions

Our analyses demonstrate that GPT-4 has strong Python code generation abilities, confirming the results of @Bubeck2023.  At the same time, the prevalence of errors in the generated code suggests that humans must remain in the loop in order to ensure the accuracy of any resulting code. Our interactive prompting experiment showed that a relatively novice prompt engineer can successfully solve coding problems within a small number of prompts the majority of the time; however, a sizeable minority of problems would have required significant human debugging in order to solve.  

Comparisons of Python code refactored using GPT-4 compared to the original demonstrated that GPT-4 improved the quality of the code, at least as measured by common metrics of software quality and standards compliance.  It should be emphasized that these results do not assess the accuracy of the code; rather, they suggest that GPT-4 can help programmers achieve code that is cleaner and potentially more maintainable than the original.  Given that GPT-4 refactoring did not eliminate all standards compliance issues, the combination GPT-4 with other code formatting tools (such as `black`) would likely result in even further improvements.

The examination of test generation by GPT-4 demonstrated that it was able to generate tests with a high degree of test coverage, but those tests failed a majority of the time.  Such test failures require additional human effort to diagnose, since it is not immediately clear whether the failure is due to inaccurate code, and inaccurate test, or both.  These results suggest that while GPT-4 is a very useful tool for generating testing frameworks for new code, the specific test examples should be designed and implemented by a human with domain expertise to ensure that the tests are accurately assessing the intended behavior for the code.

There has been substantial speculation regarding the continued role of human programmers in the face of AI coding tools.  The present results suggests that even with the latest generation of AI systems (i.e. GPT-4), human involvement is essential to ensure validity and accuracy of the resulting code.  This seems to be especially the case when programming of mathematical concepts is involved.  The lack of confidence calibration of tools like GPT-4 means that they will present answers in the same way regardless of the degree of support for the answer.  

The prompts used in the present research are almost certainly suboptimal, and thus may be underestimating the performance of the model.  For example, recent work has shown that chain-of-thought prompting can substantially improve the perfomance of LLMs on complex problems requiring reasoning [@Prystawski2022; @Wei2023], and this seems to extend to coding as well[^1].  Further work is needed to examine the degree to which such improved prompting techniques might improve the performance of LLMs on complex coding problems, and at this point our results should be taken as a lower bound on the performance of these models.
